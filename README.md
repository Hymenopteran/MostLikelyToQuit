# Most Likely To Quit - Summary

This project is based on a hypothetical dataset on HR Employee attrition and performance. It has various data describing employee characteristics. Machine Learning can help to understand and determine how these factors relate to workforce attrition.

This project shows that data analytics can be of use to HR personnel in identifing which employees are most likely to quit. This information can be passed on to business unit managers to interdict and address the issues affecting employee satisfaction. Additionally, senior management can use the anonymized results to examine if there are systemic issues – e.g., an over-reliance on overtime to complete projects, possible lack of mentorship for recent hires, inadequate compensation for sales staff– that can be addressed with changes in organizational philosophy or programs. 

It should come as no surprise that several of the key variables suggested by the models are often those which are cited in literature as significantly contributory towards voluntary termination (Griffeth). However, these models show that data analytics can provide a finer level of granularity in identifying which employees are most at risk, enabling HR staff to preemptively intercede before someone decides to make a change, thus saving the organization the expenses associated with replacing key personnel.
